# CryptoX

# a React JS application based around cryptocurrencies. I used hooks such as useState and useEffect while using Axios to interact with the Coin Gecko API. I also used React Router Dom to have dynamic routes. And i learned about useParams, DOMpurify, and navigating common issues when working with API's.
